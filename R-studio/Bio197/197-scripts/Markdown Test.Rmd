Terminal Intro
===============

One of the first things we learned in this class, is how to access the terminal. I run my software on mac, which means most programs are ran through BASH.
This was mostly a tool for moving, editing, and updating changes to documents. Git and GitHub are the main aspects of this tool.


Quick Code
----------

To move between directories: we use `cd` 

To find our current directory: we use `pwd`

To list files in a given directory: we use `ls -F`


GitHub
=======

Git is a tool for tracking changes to files on a repository. It is compatible with Python, RStudio, Terminal, and pretty much everything. You can commit changes to Git through RStudio, GitHub, or your Terminal.


```{r code}
# Code can be added anyhwere to a document #
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
