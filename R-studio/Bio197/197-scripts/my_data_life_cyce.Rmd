## Plan: 

Do background research to decide if you have enough resources and information to begin collecting data.


## Collection: 

Collect data from the sources you found in your plan.
Process: Raw data needs to be cut down and prepared via a coding program.


## Analyze: 
Usually I will have some preliminary results. At this point, I have someone double check  the conclusions that my data suggests.
Visualize: Refine your results with clear, comprehensible graphs.


## Publish: 
Store and share my results.
